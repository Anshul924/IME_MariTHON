IME MariTHON Project
📌 Project Overview

IME MariTHON is a smart solution designed to automate laytime calculation and optimize processes in the maritime industry.
The project consists of three main components: Frontend, Backend, and AI Module.

🚀 Current Status
✅ AI Module

Core AI pipeline for SOF (Statement of Facts) Event Extraction is complete.

The model works, but still needs polishing and error reduction for edge cases.

Not yet integrated with the frontend — this is planned for upcoming iterations.

🎨 Frontend

The frontend UI is almost complete.

Manual laytime calculation feature is currently not working correctly, but the issue is known and a fix is in progress.

Integration with the AI and backend is still pending.

⚙️ Backend

Backend structure is set up and functional.

Will act as the bridge between the frontend and AI modules.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React / Node.js (with manual laytime calculator UI)

Backend: Node.js / Express

AI Module: Python (NLP + ML), trained to extract maritime events from SOF documents

📅 Next Steps

🔗 Integrate AI module with frontend via backend APIs.

🛠️ Fix manual laytime calculation logic in frontend.

🧹 Improve AI accuracy and reduce parsing errors.

📊 Add more testing and validation with real-world SOF documents.
